## Module Design Principles

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle
Each module has a single, well-defined responsibility and encapsulates related functionality.

### 2. Loose Coupling
Modules communicate through well-defined interfaces and are minimally dependent on each other.

### 3. High Cohesion
Related functionality is grouped together within each module.

### 4. Interface Segregation
Modules expose only the interfaces that clients need to use.

### 5. Dependency Inversion
Modules depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations.

## Module Communication

### Internal Communication
- RESTful APIs for synchronous communication
- Message queues for asynchronous communication
- Event-driven architecture for loose coupling
- Shared database for data consistency

### External Communication
- Third-party service integrations
- Payment gateway APIs
- Email and SMS services
- File storage services
